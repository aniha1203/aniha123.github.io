<h2 id = "types"> Types of Penguins</h2>

<h3 class="penguins"> Emperor Penguins</h3>
<p> Obviously, they are big. But they too have predetors. Things such as Seals come and attack Emperor Penguins. But still they find a way to survive. Their mode of transport in water is obviously swimming. But they can transport on land quickly, too. It is not just walking or waddling, they can slide on their bellies. It is a quick way from their colony to the ocean. They can eat a lot of food when they are away from the family. </p>
<a target = "_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfstYSUscBc"> Here is a short video on Emperor Penguins.</a>

<h3 class="penguins"> Little Blue/Korora Penguins</h3>
<p> Last but not least, Little Blue Penguins. They are the smallest penguin in the world, but don't let that fool you. Little Penguins tend to come ashore from May till June. They come ashore to find a nest, which is usually in caves, under rocks, or even sometimes under homes. Adults also come ashore to shed their fur and gain a new waterproof coat. This come between November and March and they are very vulnerable during this time. </p>

<h3 class="penguins"> Adélie Penguins</h3>
<p> From anazalyzing these tables, we can see that the Adélie Penguin is way more common than the other two birds we have compared it to. Researches have seen and come to the conclusion that the Adélie Penguin is more feisty and aggresive than others, making their speceis more populated. They have been known to take on other predetors such as seagulls and seals, even attacking some sceintists with their flippers.
